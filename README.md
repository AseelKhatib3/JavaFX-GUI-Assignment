# 🎨 JavaFX GUI Text Styler

This project is an interactive **JavaFX GUI application** that allows users to fully style and control text on the screen.  
The application demonstrates clean GUI structuring, event handling, component modularization, and dynamic styling using JavaFX.

## 🧱 Project Structure

The project is divided into separate reusable JavaFX components:

### **`Main.java`**
- Builds the main layout using `BorderPane`
- Connects all GUI components together
- Handles all event listeners (color changes, movement, font size, bold/italic, combo box)
- Displays the styled text in the center pane

---

### **`topClass.java`**
A horizontal bar that contains:
- A label: *“Enter the font size:”*
- A text field to input font size  
- Updates the text size dynamically when typing

---

### **`leftClass.java`**
Vertical sidebar that contains:
- RadioButtons for selecting color  
  - 🔴 Red  
  - 🟢 Green  
  - 🔵 Blue  
- Handles color selection and applies it to the main text

---

### **`comboClass.java`**
Contains a **ComboBox** with the same color options:
- Red  
- Green  
- Blue  
Selecting a color updates the text immediately.

---

### **`rightClass.java`**
Contains two large styled CheckBoxes:
- **Bold**  
- **Italic**  
Ensures that only one can be active at a time.

---

### **`gridPaneClass.java`**
A section at the bottom containing arrow-image buttons:
- ⬅️ Left  
- ➡️ Right  
- ⬆️ Up  
- ⬇️ Down  

Pressing these buttons moves the text inside the center pane.
